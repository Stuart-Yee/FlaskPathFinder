# FlaskPathFinder
Script builds out file structure and generates server.py and mysqlconnection.py files for Flask applications

Instructions:
1. Navigate to directory where you want to set up your Flask app
2. Call FlaskPathFinder from the current working directory

Command Line Arugements:
Calling test as an argument will run test mode

Example:
If the working directory you wish to start your Flask project is c:\\Users\me\Flask_Projects\my_project and you saved FlaskPathFinder.py in c:\\Users\me\Documents, then you would navigate to c:\\Users\me\Flask_Projects\my_project and enter the command python c:\\Users\me\Documents\FlaskPathFinder.py

Recommended: It's recommended you create an alias to run FlaskPathFinder to make it that much easier to call the program when you navigate to your working directory.
